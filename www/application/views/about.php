<h4>>Content</h4>
<p>Most of what you see on this site has been collected from other resources.
These are other website services that I use such as <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://github.com/chardcastle">GitHub</a>. Jump in and engage!</p>
<h4>>Technology</h4>
<p>I've built this site using the Kohana PHP framework. I had originally planned to use Expression Engine,
 the first version of which was great. However I missed the flexibility of a framework and I don't expect
 to be publishing on a scale that requires a content management system.</p>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>This site was created as a technical exercise for myself and to <a href="http://github.com/chardcastle">share</a>
    with others. Enjoy!</p>
