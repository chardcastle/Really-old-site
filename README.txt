##############

Originally devised to be a data mash-up based website redesign. This site has become a playground of sorts for experiments and discovery. Please don't consider it as final, re-usable or even operational! As a whole, this work has become obfuscated and over complicated. Please only consider this as a demonstration of my commitment to PHP and as a user to the Kohana framework.

Please note: For security reasons, I've reset the consumer key and secret of my Twitter app. Please see developer.twitter.com for details.
